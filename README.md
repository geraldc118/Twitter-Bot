# Twitter-Bot

 This is a Twitter bot that i developed during my learning of python. 

 I used Tweepy for this project as this allowed me access to the Api controls. 

 Using version 1.1 of the twitter api

 I created the consumer keys and api keys to allow me access to my page.

 To use the program use the tweet_your_own.py file to edit the code:
 tweet.favourite > tweet.follow
 The search string 
 How many actions to take.

 A message can be changed to show that your action has been carried out in the console.
